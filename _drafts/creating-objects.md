Java programmers apparently find it very difficult to create objects. Huge amount of engineering effort has been spent writing (and using) frameworks for creating objects: dependency injection frameworks, builders, annotation-driven code generators, etc., etc.

When using Kotlin on the JVM, you can still use all those tools, but there is less need for them (and, Iâ€™d argue, less need in modern Java also). In this series, we look at the various tools Java programmers use to create objects, the Kotlin alternatives, and how to refactor from one to the other.

1. Builders
2. Test-Data Builders
3. Distinguishing between Values & Stateful Objects
4. Dependency Injection Frameworks
