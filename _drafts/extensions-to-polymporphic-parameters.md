We refactor to extract duplicate logic into extension methods. But refactoring to extension methods _itself_ leads to duplication.

Here we have lots of methods that extract a value from a row of a database query result set.

```kotlin
fun ResultSet.getOffsetDateTime(name: String): OffsetDateTime = ...
fun ResultSet.getPostCode(name: String): PostCode = ...
fun ResultSet.getTelephoneNumber(name: String): TelephoneNumber = ...
fun ResultSet.getEmailAddress(name: String): EmailAddress = ...
```

And because columns can be nullable, we also have:

```kotlin
fun ResultSet.getOffsetDateTimeOrNull(name: String): OffsetDateTime? = ...
fun ResultSet.getPostCodeOrNull(name: String): PostCode? = ...
fun ResultSet.getTelephoneNumberOrNull(name: String): TelephoneNumber? = ...
fun ResultSet.getEmailAddressOrNull(name: String): EmailAddress? = ...
```

Each extension has very similar logic:

```kotlin
fun ResultSet.getPostCodeOrNull(name: String): PostCode? {
    val strValue: String? = getString(name);
    if (wasNull()) {
        return null
    } else {
        val convertedValue = PostCode.parse(strValue!!)
        return convertedValue 
            ?: throw SqlConversionError("could not parse column $name as a PostCode")
    }
}

fun ResultSet.getPostCode(name: String) =
    getPostCodeOrNull(name)
        ?: throw SqlConversionError("column $name was null, expected non-null")
```


(Note: we are using exceptions for error handling here, for clarity.  In practice we would probably use a Result or Either type to represent either a successful conversion or a failure.)

And you address that by introducing a polymorphic parameter that embodies the variation obvious in the the extension function names (String, Date, Money, â€¦)

Then you identify groups of parameters that you always pass around together, and can factor those out into a higher level abstraction that is easier to pass around and compose into yet higher-level abstractions.
In this case, name and converter are tightly related for any result set.  So you might want to combine them into a ResultColumn abstraction.

```kotlin
data class ResultColumn<T>(name: String, toKotlin: (ResultSet,String)->Result<T,ConversionError>)
```

And then you could compose ResultColumns to define converters for structured types, or the structure of your result sets.
