title: Sample Chapter 7 - Actions to Calculations
tags:
---

We have found [Eric Normand](https://ericnormand.me/)'s division of code into Data, Calculation and Actions very useful.
He introduces the concept in his excellent [podcast](https://ericnormand.me/podcast) and book [Grokking Simplicity](https://grokkingsimplicity.com/).

Unfortunately he doesn't (yet) seem to have written about the subject on the web.
To fill this gap, we've published the introduction to [Chapter 7 - Actions to Calculations](/chapter_samples/chapter07-calculations-to-actions.html), 
which is our interpretation of at least part of the concept.
