The "Replace Conditional with Polymorphism" refactoring in [Martin Fowler's Refactoring book](https://refactoring.com) eliminates branching control flow by replacing it with polymorphic calls. Sometimes you can replace branching code with a straight-line calculation. This is frequently used in graphics and games programming. Unsurprisingly, I call this refactoring "Replace Conditional with Calculation".

## Worked Example

For example, consider the Luhn checksum algorithm that detects mistyped credit card numbers:

```kotlin
fun String.isValidCardNumber(): Boolean =
    this.reversed()
        .map { ch -> ch.digitToInt() }
        .mapIndexed { index, digit ->
            when (index % 2) {
                0    -> digit
                else -> digit * 2
            }
        }
        .sumOf {
            when {
                it >= 10 -> it / 10 + it % 10
                else     -> it
            }
        }
        .let { checkSum -> checkSum % 10 == 0 }
```

This has two conditional statements, both of which can be replaced by straight-line integer calculations.

IntelliJ encodes some mathematical reasoning into its refactoring tools, particularly [De Morganâ€™s laws of boolean algebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws). However, it does not encode enough rules of arithmetic to automatically replace conditional statements with numeric calculations. We have to rely on our own knowledge of arithmetic and the behaviour of Kotlin's integer arithmetic operators to recognise where and how we can replace conditionals with calculations.

To see how, let's start with the first when expression in the function, and baby-step our way through the process of working out a calculation that can replace it:

```kotlin
when (index % 2) {
    0 -> digit
    else -> digit * 2
}
```

We can duplicate the `else` branch for the case when `index % 2` is 1, without changing the meaning of the when expression:

```kotlin
when (index % 2) {
    0 -> digit
    1 -> digit * 2
    else -> digit * 2
}
```

Because `index % 2` is either zero or one, the else branch is unreachable code. We can prove this to ourselves by changing the else branch to throw an exception and seeing that our tests still pass: 

```kotlin
when (index % 2) {
    0 -> digit
    1 -> digit * 2
    else -> error("unreachable")
}
```

Let's make the two branches have the same "shape":

```kotlin
when (index % 2) {
    0 -> digit * 1
    1 -> digit * 2
    else -> error("unreachable")
}
```

We can now lift the multiplication out of the when expression. 


Note: At the time of writing, IntelliJ can lift _return_ statements out of a conditional expression, but unfortunately it cannot do the same for common subexpressions. We have to do it by hand.


```kotlin
digit * when (index % 2) {
    0 -> 1
    1 -> 2
    else -> error("unreachable")
}
```

Now it is obvious that the conditional is calculating `index % 2 + 1`, so we can replace the entire when expression with that calculation:

```kotlin
digit * (index % 2 + 1)
```

This leaves the function as:

```kotlin
fun String.isValidCardNumber(): Boolean =
    this.reversed()
        .map { ch -> ch.digitToInt() }
        .mapIndexed { index, digit -> digit * (index % 2 + 1) }
        .sumOf {
            when {
                it >= 10 -> it / 10 + it % 10
                else     -> it
            }
        }
        .let { checkSum -> checkSum % 10 == 0 }
```

Because we now have one reference to `digit` we can combine the first two map and mapIndexed calls into one:

```kotlin
fun String.isValidCardNumber(): Boolean =
    this.reversed()
        .mapIndexed { index, ch -> ch.digitToInt()  * (index % 2 + 1) }
        .sumOf {
            when {
                it >= 10 -> it / 10 + it % 10
                else     -> it
            }
        }
        .let { checkSum -> checkSum % 10 == 0 }
```

The second conditional sums individual digits.
Given the behaviour of Kotlin's integer arithmetic operators, the branching is unnecessary. 
If the intermediate value, `it`, is less than ten, then `it / 10` would be zero, and `it % 10` would be equal to `it`, meaning we can replace the entire when expression with `it / 10 + it % 10`, leaving the function as: 

```kotlin
fun String.isValidCardNumber(): Boolean =
    this.reversed()
        .mapIndexed { index, ch -> ch.digitToInt() * (index % 2 + 1) }
        .sumOf { it / 10 + it % 10 }
        .let { checkSum -> checkSum % 10 == 0 }
```


## Replace Calculation with Conditional

The intent of a calculation can be harder to understand than of explicit conditional code. 
Just as you can refactor between conditionals and polymorphism in either direction, from conditionals to polymorphism or from polymorphism to conditionals, so you can refactor between conditionals and calculations.


## Be Careful of Optimising When You Should Be Refactoring

The `reversed()` call copies the string data, and `mapIndexed` creates a temporary `List<Int>`. We can use `foldIndexed` to eliminate these allocations, but the logic is then much harder to understand:

```kotlin
fun String.isValidCardNumber(): Boolean =
    foldIndexed(0) { index, subtotal, ch -> 
        subtotal + sumDigits(ch.digitToInt() * (2 - (length - index) % 2)) 
    }
    .let { checkSum -> checkSum % 10 == 0 }

private fun sumDigits(i: Int): Int = i / 10 + i % 10
```

I have to keep in mind whether I am refactoring to make the logic easier to understand, or optimising for performance.
I find it too easy to slip from one mode to the other.
A second pair of eyes helps: my pair-programming partner would stop me long before I could commit impenetrable logic like this.
