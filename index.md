> "The fastest way to upgrade your skills from Java to Kotlin. 
> Essential reading for any professional Java developer."
> 
> —Dawn Griffiths & David Griffiths,
> authors of Head First Kotlin.

> "Nat and Duncan open the book by saying they wish this book had existed when they adopted Kotlin. 
> I completely agree. The book takes their experiences, their trials and errors, and helps you, the reader, to be on the right path. 
> It definitely is  a book that should be on anyone’s shelf coming to Kotlin from the JVM ecosystem. 
> An enjoyable read, and an even better reference guide!"
> 
> —Hadi Hariri, JetBrains developer advocate and host of the [Talking Kotlin podcast](https://talkingkotlin.com/).

> "To take familiar good old Java code and see it transform, incrementally, into concise, clear, expressive and easy to maintain Kotlin code is a wonderful way to learn the language. 
> Benefit from the experience McGregor and Pryce have distilled in this book."
> 
> —Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, 
> award-winning author and founder of Agile Developer, Inc.
