> I have been using Java for over 10 years, this book is a “breakthrough” for me, it not only helped me develop a “functional thing” when approaching a new problem, it also helped guiding me in migrating existing code (if we want to) in a safe and progressive manner through refactoring and tooling. It was a very enjoyable read, I have to admit that after 10 years of Java/OO/updating mutable state, to step into this next level, I need to (and I am willing to) completely “rewire” my brain to a more functional settings. I know where my currently gap is and what my future approach might look like, and I am convinced that the continued learning and practicing will lead to better (more concise, reasonable, composable, immutable) software. Great thanks to Duncan and Nat.
