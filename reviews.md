Extremely well written. Gives historical context as to why Kotlin is what it is and how that fixes issues that were accumulated in the Java througout the years. A great intro on how to start with Java to Kotlin conversion on your projects.

I have been using Java for over 10 years, this book is a “breakthrough” for me, it not only helped me develop a “functional thing” when approaching a new problem, it also helped guiding me in migrating existing code (if we want to) in a safe and progressive manner through refactoring and tooling. It was a very enjoyable read, I have to admit that after 10 years of Java/OO/updating mutable state, to step into this next level, I need to (and I am willing to) completely “rewire” my brain to a more functional settings. I know where my currently gap is and what my future approach might look like, and I am convinced that the continued learning and practicing will lead to better (more concise, reasonable, composable, immutable) software. Great thanks to Duncan and Nat.

Even if you don’t write Java this book is invaluable. Much of it can be applied to Swift or even Javascript
