    Most chapters in the book have some discussion about how we might do things in Java, then how to achieve the
    same in Kotlin, followed by an example of how to refactor to the Kotlin way of doing things.
</p>

<p>
    Here we present some of the discussions. If you want the refactorings, then please <a href="/">buy the book</a>!
